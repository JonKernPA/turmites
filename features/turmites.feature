  Scenario Outline: turmites eating squares
    Given a turmite is spawned
    And my current state is <state>
    When I move to the next square which is <color>
    Then I should have turned 90째 <direction> and end up facing <heading>
    And the square should change to <write_color>
    And my state should change to <next_state>

  Examples:
    | state | color | direction | heading | write_color | next_state |
    | 0     | 0     | right     | east    | 1           | 0          |
    | 0     | 1     | right     | east    | 1           | 1          |
